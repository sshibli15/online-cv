    details: |
      I was brought on board to design and implement the replacement of the
      database-centric search with Google-based search using the Google
      Search Appliance (GSA). One of the challenges was to replace the
      entire search engine keeping the existing User Interface. On top of
      this, the client also demanded to be able to search any changed or
      newly added grant in real-time -- instantaneously. In addition to this
      significant change, I also designed and implemented a solution where
      information from the old legacy system and the new system could be
      searched, rendered, updated, and deleted (CRUD) seamlessly. This new
      feature was a requirement by the stakeholders in the middle of the
      project and needed a thought. Without an experienced and passionate
      brain, the project would not have been delivered without moving the
      dates. The entire application would have to be, either, re-written or
      broken into pieces where recovery would have been a big challenge
